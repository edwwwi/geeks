### Project Description
This project is an Automatic Pikachu-Voice Converter that records your voice, then modifies and replays it with a pitch-perfect Pikachu sound effect! A fun tool to bring out your inner Pokémon.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There are too many boring, human-sounding voices in the world. Where's the charm, the spark, the pika-pika?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With Pikachu-ify, you can instantly transform your voice into Pikachu's! Just press a button, say anything, and let our program handle the rest. Say goodbye to mundane, and hello to electric vocal transformations!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages - Python,HTML
- Frameworks - Flask (for the backend server)
- Libraries used -  PyAudio (for recording), NumPy (for audio processing), Soundfile (for saving modified audio), HTTPServer (for web-based interaction)
- Tools used - Visual Studio Code, Web browser for testing

For Hardware:

Main Components:

Microphone (to capture your voice)
Computer or Raspberry Pi (to run the software and process audio)
Speakers or Headphones (to play back the modified audio)

Specifications:
Microphone: Standard USB or 3.5mm microphone
Computer Specifications: Minimum 4GB RAM, 2 GHz Processor (to handle real-time audio processing)
Storage: 10 MB (to store temporary audio files)
Audio Output: Speakers or Headphones for playback with clear audio output

Tools Required:
USB cables (for connecting microphone and other peripherals)
Soldering kit (optional, if connecting the microphone to a custom hardware setup)
Debugging tools (such as a multimeter, if testing audio circuitry with custom setups)
Hardware enclosures (to protect equipment if using Raspberry Pi or portable setup)

### Implementation
For Software: 
1. Setting Up the Server
Begin by setting up a basic HTTP server to handle client requests to start audio recording and playback. Use Python’s http.server for a simple web interface.
2. Recording Audio
Record audio using pyaudio. Capture microphone input at a sample rate of 44100 Hz with a duration defined by the user.
3. Applying Pitch Modification
Use numpy to modify the pitch by changing the sample rate.
4. Web Interface for User Interaction
Create a basic HTML front end with a button to start recording and playback.
5. Running the Server
Use Python’s HTTPServer to run the server and handle incoming requests.
6. Testing
Access http://localhost:8000 in a browser to test recording, pitch modification, and playback.

# Installation

### Project Documentation
For Software:
Our project, **PIKACHU**, is a simple yet entertaining web application that allows users to record audio directly from their browser and instantly replay it with a humorous pitch modification. This Python-based web server captures a 5-second audio recording, adjusts its pitch, and plays it back with a fun twist, making it ideal for quick and playful voice transformations.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever wished your voice could sound like a cartoon character at the click of a button? Or maybe you've wondered what you'd sound like as a supervillain? This project solves the non-existent, yet irresistible problem of *instant voice transformation.*

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
With the press of a button, this web application captures audio, transforms it with a funny pitch effect, and replays it instantly. The solution you didn’t know you needed for surprising friends or just giving yourself a laugh!
